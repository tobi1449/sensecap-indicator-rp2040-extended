## Extended Firmware for RP2040 of SenseCap Indicator D1S
This firmware for the RP2040 of the SenseCap Indicator D1s was taken from https://github.com/Seeed-Solution/SenseCAP_Indicator_RP2040/tree/main, but extended to also provide temperature and humidity readings of the built-in SCD41 sensor and to allow configuring the altitude adjustments of the SCD41.
